In Liberia this information is lacking. The only way to keep track is through civil registration. Civil registration is also needed to safeguard individual rights to social status and benefits. The practical aim of CMI's birth registration pilot project in Liberia (2009) is to have a functioning mobile birth registration data collation system supporting the computerization of birth registration process in one county. New funding is applied for 2010-12 to expand the system to all 15 counties. The general aim is to learn how a mobile birth registration data collation tool can facilitate and bring added value to the computerizing of the birth registration process and through that function, become a population information collation tool to other countries too."

Accurate birth registration allows the Government of Tanzania to effectively and efficiently plan for health, education, and child protection services and ensure that children have access to these services. The project supports the scaling up of an innovative birth registration system, which was developed by Tanzania s birth registration agency in partnership with Tigo (a mobile service provider). The system uses innovative technology that quickly uploads records of all birth registrations to a centralized system through text messages sent from mobile phones. This allows for real-time monitoring of birth registrations at national, regional and local levels and greatly simplifies the registration process.   Some project activities include: (1) training local government registration agents, specifically health workers and Ward Executive Officers; (2) entering into a public-private partnership with key mobile service providers operating in the ten regions; (3) conducting public awareness campaigns to support the implementation of the new birth registration system in each region; (4) assisting the Government of Tanzania to finalize the new Birth and Death Registration law; (5) coordinating an inter-ministerial committee on civil registration and vital statistics; and (6) training a core team of national facilitators to scale up the new birth registration system across mainland Tanzania. / Le projet a pour objectif d enregistrer la naissance de 3,5 millions de filles et de garçons âgés de moins de cinq ans (dont 90 p. 100 des nouveau-nés et 70 p. 100 des enfants non enregistrés) et de délivrer des actes de naissance pour ces derniers dans dix régions de la Tanzanie continentale. L enregistrement exact des naissances permet au gouvernement de la Tanzanie de planifier de façon efficace et efficiente les services de santé, d éducation et de protection de l enfance et de faire en sorte que les enfants aient accès à ces services. Le projet appuie la mise à niveau d un système novateur d enregistrement des naissances conçu par l organisme d enregistrement des naissances de la Tanzanie en collaboration avec Tigo (fournisseur de services mobiles). Le système fait appel à une technologie novatrice qui télécharge rapidement tous les actes de naissance dans un système centralisé au moyen de messages textes envoyés par téléphone mobile. Il devient ainsi possible de surveiller en temps réel les enregistrements de naissances à l échelon national, régional et local, ce qui simplifie grandement le processus d enregistrement.

A birth certificate allows children to access health services and education, giving them the opportunity to achieve their full potential as active and productive citizens. Children are the primary beneficiaries of the project, but some activities are also aimed at vulnerable unregistered adults.   Project activities include the following: (1) improving governments  capacity to design and apply policies to facilitate inclusive civil registration, by developing national work plans, training registrars and providing technical assistance to the selected national governments; (2) improving registrars  capacity to register unregistered children in a timely and secure manner and to educate unregistered persons about their civil registration rights and responsibilities, by implementing tools to measure the level of service delivery to children, training officials in delivering services to everyone, and modernizing technological equipment to better protect personal information; (3) building governments  capacity to use international standards in managing civil registries and to recognize identity documents from other countries, by sharing best practices, training employees and translating key documents for dissemination.   The project is in keeping with Canada s priorities for strengthening child protection and supporting maternal, newborn and child health. / Ce projet vise à améliorer la protection des enfants et d autres personnes vulnérables en Amérique latine et dans les Caraïbes par un appui à l enregistrement des naissances de deux millions d enfants de moins de cinq ans, facilitant l accès des personnes à une identité juridique.

About 220,000 children and mothers die every year in Ethiopia.  For most, the causes of death are unknown, with fewer than 30% of Ethiopia's births and deaths being registered. The lack of information makes evidence-based decision-making difficult.  This project will increase the quality of local evidence to help guide Ethiopian priorities by increasing the awareness of causes of maternal, childhood and neonatal deaths. This project will also contribute to global emerging evidence under the Centre of Excellence for strengthening civil registration and vital statistics, which is part of Canada's contribution to the work being undertaken through the Global Financing Facility focusing on the unmet challenges facing many high burden countries to improve maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health.This project aims to generate a national open-source catalogue for cause of death (COD) data from 1990 onward and also pilot 'Global Resource to Accelerate Accurate Death Estimation and Evaluation (GRADE)' platform to decrease the cost, while increasing the quality and feasibility, of COD surveys.  The generated evidence will link causes of death to maternal and child health outcomes, which can be used to inform future policy.The project will provide Ethiopia with its first ever representative data on the causes of neonatal and maternal deaths, which will serve to better identify gaps in health services for mothers and children.  This will enable causes of maternal death to be understood and help Ethiopia in achieving its commitment to reduce preventable deaths by 40% by 2030, as proposed by the new UN Sustainable Development Goals.  As part of national efforts to strengthen civil registration and vital statistics, the goal of this project is to overcome the maternal, newborn, and child health  'Know-Do Gap' in Ethiopia by piloting a low-cost, high-quality COD data collection and monitoring system at the national level.  This will enable scalable solutions to address the critical gaps in maternal and child mortality that can influence local, national and global efforts.This project is part of the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa (IMCHA) initiative (2014-2020), a CAD 36 million multi-donor partnership funded by Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and Canada's International Development Research Centre."

Accurate birth registration allows the Government of Tanzania to effectively and efficiently plan for health, education, and child protection services and ensure that children have access to these services. The project supports the scaling up of an innovative birth registration system, which was developed by Tanzania's birth registration agency in partnership with Tigo (a mobile service provider). The system uses innovative technology that quickly uploads records of all birth registrations to a centralized system through text messages sent from mobile phones. This allows for real-time monitoring of birth registrations at national, regional and local levels and greatly simplifies the registration process.   Some project activities include: (1) training local government registration agents, specifically health workers and Ward Executive Officers; (2) entering into a public-private partnership with key mobile service providers operating in the ten regions; (3) conducting public awareness campaigns to support the implementation of the new birth registration system in each region; (4) assisting the Government of Tanzania to finalize the new Birth and Death Registration law; (5) coordinating an inter-ministerial committee on civil registration and vital statistics; and (6) training a core team of national facilitators to scale up the new birth registration system across mainland Tanzania. / Le projet a pour objectif d'enregistrer la naissance de 3,5 millions de filles et de garçons âgés de moins de cinq ans (dont 90 p. 100 des nouveau-nés et 70 p. 100 des enfants non enregistrés) et de délivrer des actes de naissance pour ces derniers dans dix régions de la Tanzanie continentale. L'enregistrement exact des naissances permet au gouvernement de la Tanzanie de planifier de façon efficace et efficiente les services de santé, d'éducation et de protection de l'enfance et de faire en sorte que les enfants aient accès à ces services. Le projet appuie la mise à niveau d'un système novateur d'enregistrement des naissances conçu par l'organisme d'enregistrement des naissances de la Tanzanie en collaboration avec Tigo (fournisseur de services mobiles). Le système fait appel à une technologie novatrice qui télécharge rapidement tous les actes de naissance dans un système centralisé au moyen de messages textes envoyés par téléphone mobile. Il devient ainsi possible de surveiller en temps réel les enregistrements de naissances à l'échelon national, régional et local, ce qui simplifie grandement le processus d'enregistrement.

The project reinforces national registrars so they can register 95% of newborns each year and improve service delivery to vulnerable unregistered children in target countries. A birth certificate allows children to access health services and education, giving them the opportunity to achieve their full potential as active and productive citizens. Children are the primary beneficiaries of the project, but some activities are also aimed at vulnerable unregistered adults.   Project activities include the following: (1) improving governments' capacity to design and apply policies to facilitate inclusive civil registration, by developing national work plans, training registrars and providing technical assistance to the selected national governments; (2) improving registrars' capacity to register unregistered children in a timely and secure manner and to educate unregistered persons about their civil registration rights and responsibilities, by implementing tools to measure the level of service delivery to children, training officials in delivering services to everyone, and modernizing technological equipment to better protect personal information; (3) building governments' capacity to use international standards in managing civil registries and to recognize identity documents from other countries, by sharing best practices, training employees and translating key documents for dissemination.   The project is in keeping with Canada's priorities for strengthening child protection and supporting maternal, newborn and child health. / Ce projet vise à améliorer la protection des enfants et d'autres personnes vulnérables en Amérique latine et dans les Caraibes par un appui à l'enregistrement des naissances de deux millions d'enfants de moins de cinq ans, facilitant l'accès des personnes à une identité juridique.

The project reinforces national registrars so they can register 95% of newborns each year and improve service delivery to vulnerable unregistered children in target countries. A birth certificate allows children to access health services and education, giving them the opportunity to achieve their full potential as active and productive citizens. Children are the primary beneficiaries of the project, but some activities are also aimed at vulnerable unregistered adults.   Project activities include the following: (1) improving governments' capacity to design and apply policies to facilitate inclusive civil registration, by developing national work plans, training registrars and providing technical assistance to the selected national governments; (2) improving registrars' capacity to register unregistered children in a timely and secure manner and to educate unregistered persons about their civil registration rights and responsibilities, by implementing tools to measure the level of service delivery to children, training officials in delivering services to everyone, and modernizing technological equipment to better protect personal information; (3) building governments' capacity to use international standards in managing civil registries and to recognize identity documents from other countries, by sharing best practices, training employees and translating key documents for dissemination.   The project is in keeping with Canada's priorities for strengthening child protection and supporting maternal, newborn and child health. / Ce projet vise à améliorer la protection des enfants et d'autres personnes vulnérables en Amérique latine et dans les Caraibes par un appui à l'enregistrement des naissances de deux millions d'enfants de moins de cinq ans, facilitant l'accès des personnes à une identité juridique.

Un certificat de naissance permet aux enfants de bénéficier d'un accès aux services de santé et à l'éducation, leur offrant l'opportunité d'atteindre leur plein potentiel en tant que citoyens actifs et productifs. Les enfants sont les bénéficiaires primaires du projet, mais certaines activités s'adressent également aux adultes vulnérables non enregistrés.   Parmi les activités du projet : 1) accroitre la capacité des gouvernements à concevoir et appliquer des politiques pour faciliter l'enregistrement civil inclusif par l'élaboration de plans de travail nationaux, la formation aux registraires et de l'assistance technique aux gouvernements nationaux sélectionnés; 2) accroitre la capacité des r"

About 220,000 children and mothers die every year in Ethiopia. For most, the causes of death are unknown as fewer than 30% of Ethiopia's births and deaths are registered. The lack of information makes evidence-based decision-making difficult.As part of national efforts to strengthen civil registration and vital statistics, the goal of this project is to overcome the maternal, newborn, and child health Know-Do Gap in Ethiopia by piloting a low-cost, high-quality cause-of-death (COD) data collection and monitoring system at the national level. This will enable the development of scalable solutions to address critical gaps in maternal and child mortality that can influence local, national, and global efforts.This project aims to generate a national open-source catalogue for COD data from 1990 onward. It will also pilot a Global Resource to Accelerate Accurate Death Estimation and Evaluation (GRADE) platform to decrease the cost, while increasing the quality and feasibility, of COD surveys. This project will increase the quality of local evidence to help guide Ethiopian priorities by building awareness of causes of maternal, childhood, and neonatal deaths. It will also contribute to emerging evidence at the global level under the Centre of Excellence for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems. This is part of Canada's contribution to the work being undertaken through the Global Financing Facility focusing on the challenges facing many high burden countries to improve maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health.The project will provide Ethiopia with its first-ever representative data on the causes of neonatal and maternal deaths, which will serve to better identify gaps in health services for mothers and children. The evidence will link causes of death to maternal and child health outcomes, which can be used to inform future policy. This will help Ethiopia to achieve its commitment to reduce preventable deaths by 40% by 2030, as proposed by the new UN Sustainable Development Goals.This project is part of the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa (IMCHA) initiative (2014-2020), a seven-year, $CA36 million multi-donor partnership funded by Global Affairs Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and Canada's International Development Research Centre."

The lack of information makes evidence-based decision-making difficult.As part of national efforts to strengthen civil registration and vital statistics, the goal of this project is to overcome the maternal, newborn, and child health 'Know-Do Gap' in Ethiopia by piloting a low-cost, high-quality cause-of-death (COD) data collection and monitoring system at the national level. This will enable the development of scalable solutions to address critical gaps in maternal and child mortality that can influence local, national, and global efforts.This project aims to generate a national open-source catalogue for COD data from 1990 onward. It will also pilot a 'Global Resource to Accelerate Accurate Death Estimation and Evaluation (GRADE)' platform to decrease the cost, while increasing the quality and feasibility, of COD surveys. This project will increase the quality of local evidence to help guide Ethiopian priorities by building awareness of causes of maternal, childhood, and neonatal deaths. It will also contribute to emerging evidence at the global level under the Centre of Excellence for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems. This is part of Canada's contribution to the work being undertaken through the Global Financing Facility focusing on the challenges facing many high burden countries to improve maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health.The project will provide Ethiopia with its first-ever representative data on the causes of neonatal and maternal deaths, which will serve to better identify gaps in health services for mothers and children. The evidence will link causes of death to maternal and child health outcomes, which can be used to inform future policy. This will help Ethiopia to achieve its commitment to reduce preventable deaths by 40% by 2030, as proposed by the new UN Sustainable Development Goals.This project is part of the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa (IMCHA) initiative (2014-2020), a seven-year, $CA36 million multi-donor partnership funded by Global Affairs Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and Canada's International Development Research Centre."

Accurate birth registration allows the Government of Tanzania to effectively and efficiently plan for health, education, and child protection services and ensure that children have access to these services. The project supports the scaling up of an innovative birth registration system, which was developed by Tanzania's birth registration agency in partnership with Tigo (a mobile service provider). The system uses innovative technology that quickly uploads records of all birth registrations to a centralized system through text messages sent from mobile phones. This allows for real-time monitoring of birth registrations at national, regional and local levels and greatly simplifies the registration process.Some project activities include: (1) training local government registration agents, specifically health workers and Ward Executive Officers; (2) entering into a public-private partnership with key mobile service providers operating in the ten regions; (3) conducting public awareness campaigns to support the implementation of the new birth registration system in each region; (4) assisting the Government of Tanzania to finalize the new Birth and Death Registration law; (5) coordinating an inter-ministerial committee on civil registration and vital statistics; and (6) training a core team of national facilitators to scale up the new birth registration system across mainland Tanzania./ Le projet a pour objectif d'enregistrer la naissance de 3,5 millions de filles et de garçons âgés de moins de cinq ans (dont 90 p. 100 des nouveau-nés et 70 p. 100 des enfants non enregistrés) et de délivrer des actes de naissance pour ces derniers dans dix régions de la Tanzanie continentale. L'enregistrement exact des naissances permet au gouvernement de la Tanzanie de planifier de façon efficace et efficiente les services de santé, d'éducation et de protection de l'enfance et de faire en sorte que les enfants aient accès à ces services. Le projet appuie la mise à niveau d'un système novateur d'enregistrement des naissances conçu par l'organisme d'enregistrement des naissances de la Tanzanie en collaboration avec Tigo (fournisseur de services mobiles). Le système fait appel à une technologie novatrice qui télécharge rapidement tous les actes de naissance dans un système centralisé au moyen de messages textes envoyés par téléphone mobile. Il devient ainsi possible de surveiller en temps réel les enregistrements de naissances à l'échelon national, régional et local, ce qui simplifie grandement le processus d'enregistrement.Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) la formation d'agents d'enregistrement au sein des administrations municipales, particulièrement les professionnels de la santé et les responsables administratifs; 2) la conclusion de partenari"
