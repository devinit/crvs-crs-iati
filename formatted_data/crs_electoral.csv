Improved transparency and effectiveness of polling where election monitors are present, contributing to decreased opportunities for vote tampering 2. Voters better informed about issues relating to elections and the democratic process through exposure to gender-sensitive voter education material, including active participation of women and men in democracy monitoring 3. Elections analysed and monitoring reports produced with recommendations for improving the democratic process in Nigeria and lessons-learned for strengthening electoral procedures 4. Strengthened capacity of JDPC in project management, RBM, and a bolstered network of contacts        Expected Outputs / Short-term Results:  1. Effective voter education material produced, including 100,000 copies of training manual on election monitoring and voter education; and 100,000 each of posters, stickers, t-shirts, and radio and TV jingles 2. Approximately 10,000 elections and democracy monitors effectively trained, mobilized, and present during polling process 3. Elections effectively monitored in 18 states 4. Data on election results gathered and analyzed        Gender Equality Measures:  There are a number of entry points through which this project can contribute to achieving gender equality in Nigeria. Nigeria rates low, even among African nations, in the number of women elected to political positions. This is particularly disconcerting given the numbers of highly educated women in Nigeria. The bilateral desk has shared CIDA's Policy on Gender Equality with the implementing organizations and has made recommendations for consideration in project design. Two key areas to be monitored will be the number of women who took part in the training sessions and the content of the voter education material. We have asked that the project take special measures to ensure the participation of women in training sessions and that gender equality be adequately addressed in the voter education material.      Environment: No direct environmental benefits are expected from a project of this nature. Nevertheless, under democratic rule, the GON has made a strong commitment to improving environmental management. President Obasanjo created Nigeria's first Ministry of Environment, during his administration, raising the profile of this portfolio to cabinet level status. It is thus demonstrated that democratic governance has had a positive influence on environmental management in Nigeria.   Further analysis of Nigeria's environmental challenges and policies are reviewed in the CIDA Environment Strategy for Nigeria, produced by the bilateral desk. In terms of this project's relationship to the environment, we can say that based on past experience democratic governance, bolstered by competitive multiparty elections, will bode well for improved environmental management in Nigeria."

Improved transparency and effectiveness of polling where election monitors are present, contributing to decreased opportunities for vote tampering 2. Voters better informed about issues relating to elections and the democratic process through exposure to gender-sensitive voter education material, including active participation of women and men in democracy monitoring 3. Elections analysed and monitoring reports produced with recommendations for improving the democratic process in Nigeria and lessons-learned for strengthening electoral procedures 4. Strengthened capacity of JDPC in project management, RBM, and a bolstered network of contacts        Expected Outputs / Short-term Results:  1. Effective voter education material produced, including 100,000 copies of training manual on election monitoring and voter education; and 100,000 each of posters, stickers, t-shirts, and radio and TV jingles 2. Approximately 10,000 elections and democracy monitors effectively trained, mobilized, and present during polling process 3. Elections effectively monitored in 18 states 4. Data on election results gathered and analyzed        Gender Equality Measures:  There are a number of entry points through which this project can contribute to achieving gender equality in Nigeria. Nigeria rates low, even among African nations, in the number of women elected to political positions. This is particularly disconcerting given the numbers of highly educated women in Nigeria. The bilateral desk has shared CIDA's Policy on Gender Equality with the implementing organizations and has made recommendations for consideration in project design. Two key areas to be monitored will be the number of women who took part in the training sessions and the content of the voter education material. We have asked that the project take special measures to ensure the participation of women in training sessions and that gender equality be adequately addressed in the voter education material.      Environment: No direct environmental benefits are expected from a project of this nature. Nevertheless, under democratic rule, the GON has made a strong commitment to improving environmental management. President Obasanjo created Nigeria's first Ministry of Environment, during his administration, raising the profile of this portfolio to cabinet level status. It is thus demonstrated that democratic governance has had a positive influence on environmental management in Nigeria.   Further analysis of Nigeria's environmental challenges and policies are reviewed in the CIDA Environment Strategy for Nigeria, produced by the bilateral desk. In terms of this project's relationship to the environment, we can say that based on past experience democratic governance, bolstered by competitive multiparty elections, will bode well for improved environmental management in Nigeria."

CANADA CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN ACEH THROUGH SUPPORT TO THE FOLLOW-UP EU ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSION TO THE SECOND ROUND ELECTIONS ON MARCH 4TH, 2007.   THE DECEMBER 26, 2004 EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI RESULTED IN SEVERE LOSS OF LIFE AND MASSIVE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY AND DAMAGE IN ACEH, INDONESIA. IN TOTAL, FOURTEEN DISTRICTS IN ACEH PROVINCE, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF SMALL ISLANDS THAT FORM PART OF THE PROVINCE OF NORTH SUMATRA, WERE DEVASTATED BY THE TSUNAMI. APPROXIMATELY 167,000 PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE DIED IN ACEH AND NORTH SUMATRA. IN ADDITION, OVER 500,000 WERE DISPLACED IN ACEH ALONE. APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME (PARTICULARLY IN THE AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES SECTORS) AND TOTAL ECONOMIC LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED AT US $4 TO $5 BILLION, A SUM EQUIVALENT TO 97% OF ACEH'S GDP.   PRIOR TO THE TSUNAMI HITTING THE SHORES OF ACEH, THIRTY YEARS OF VIOLENT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA (GOI) AND THE FREE ACEH MOVEMENT (GAM) HAD ALREADY DEVASTATED LARGE PARTS OF ACEH AND CLAIMED OVER 15,000 LIVES.   ON AUGUST 15TH, 2005, THE GOI AND THE GAM SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) SIGNIFYING AN END TO THE BRUTAL CONFLICT. TO DATE, THE MOU HAS EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS. MANY ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT THE 2004 TSUNAMI ACTED AS A CATALYST TO ENCOURAGE THE CONFLICTING PARTIES TOWARDS PEACE.   THE GUBERNATORIAL AND DISTRICT ELECTIONS IN ACEH PROVINCE, INDONESIA, IN DECEMBER, WERE THE FIRST OF THEIR KIND, AND ARE A KEY ASPECT OF THE MOU.

CIDA'S RECONSTRUCTION ASSISTANCE TO ACEH AND NIAS IS GUIDED BY ITS RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY, WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO COMPLIMENT THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA'S MASTER PLAN FOR RECONSTRUCTION. CIDA'S RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY FOR ACEH AND NIAS HAS TWO MAIN THRUSTS: (1) REBUILDING AND STRENGTHENING THE SYSTEM OF LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND (2) RESTORING LIVELIHOODS.

In implementing this project, UNDP will work closely with the Ministries of Interior (MOI), Women's Affairs (MOWA), and UNAMA. The project will mainly involve the deployment of international advisors to each IEC Secretariat department. The advisors will mentor each Department Head on day-to-day operations and build capacity through on-the-job coaching.   The joint civil and voter registry will reviewed, and lessons learned from its development will be col-lated and fed into the design and planning of a nationwide joint voter/civil registry exercise which will issue a national identification document (ID) for all citizens above fifteen years of age. The national ID will link the voters to individual polling stations preventing the risk of issuing multiple voter registration cards to a single voter. It will also be used to establish polling stations in locations that will improve the accessibility of the voters.   The Voter and Civil Registration pilot project will strive to link up with other government projects im-plemented by the Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Interior, which are also based on extending and systematizing the government's administrative control at the sub-national level through the use of com-mon processes and documents.

It is planned that a Constituent Assembly (CA) election will take place in mid-2007.  There is a  need for an impartial international organization that is not directly involved in nor providing technical assistance to the process to independently monitor the transition surrounding the elections.  Such monitoring will help build confidence in the process and ensure that the election takes place in an environment free from fear, violence, or fraud.   The Carter Center proposes to address this need with a twelve-month project to monitor and assess the electoral and transitional process in Nepal to support the consolidation of peace and democracy in the country. Because the Center will not provide direct technical assistance to any of the stakeholders, it is uniquely positioned to carry out impartial monitoring and assessment activity in Nepal.  Where appropriate, based upon monitoring activities, the Center will draw upon President Carter's expertise and the Center's previous experience to provide informal advice on electoral and political issues.  The Center's activities will be complementary to and closely coordinated with that of the United Nations but will serve a distinctly separate function.

The goal of this one year transition project is to continue to enhance the Government of Ghana's policy management process. The project will strengthen the foundations of Ghana's executive decision-making system through the application of products, procedures and processes developed in the previous phase of the Central Governance project. It will also build the capacity of the Ghanaian management to implement reforms. The Government of Ghana asked CIDA to assist with the development of its executive decision-making system, which is a central element of its overall public sector reforms. The project, by June 2009, made substantial progress in continuing to strengthen policy management processes of the Government of Ghana begun under the Central Governance Reform Project. The current project has contributed to the increased knowledge and application of skills of policy development and decision-making requirements of staff in key central Ministries and Departments (including Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning, Food and Agriculture, Local Government and Rural Development, Health, Education and Women and Children's Affairs) as well as the Office of the President. The use of standard formats and tracking of Cabinet documents has continued successfully, demonstrating integration and usefulness of the new processes into the Government's practices. The transition from one government to another following the December 2008 elections has gone well; handover notes prepared by each Ministry and Department by outgoing Ministers for those incoming made an important contribution to a smooth transition. / Ce projet fait suite au projet de Réformes de la gouvernance au niveau du gouvernement central, projet qui a pris fin en juin 2008.

Yet for the election to be considered credible, the quality of the Tunisian voter register will need to be assured.  The current voter register is considered to be out of date and inaccurate, and will allow for the participation of only a proportion of eligible citizens.  Alternative methods for improving the voter register  including through creating a new register to be extracted form the National ID card database  may be effective but are untested. The body responsible for determining whether or not to adopt a new voter register during their preparations of a new Electoral Code  the Technical Commission for Political Reform and Democratic Transition (TCPR)  has limited technical knowledge and experience in core electoral issues generally, and on approaches for voter registration reform in particular.  In order to successfully address the issues related to voter registration, the TCPR needs immediate support to build its capacity through technical advice and assistance.

This reality, coupled with the absence of representative institutions, has created a vacuum that urgently needs to be filled appropriately and qualitatively in order to enable a peaceful transition to democracy and stability. In particular the youth, representing over 67% of the Libyan population, and women are two groups that continue to face exclusion and lack of opportunity, including political opportunity. Women's empowerment, especially political empowerment, is of paramount importance during this transition period in a society where women have traditionally suffered from exclusion and lack of representation. Efforts are needed, by International IDEA and others, to assist a broad range of Libyan stakeholders interested in implementing activities targeting the political empowerment of women, both as voters and as candidates in the coming elections. The National Transitional Council (NTC) has adopted an ambitious roadmap for the transitional process, including the election of a constituent assembly to prepare a new and democratic social contract for the country. Considering the many gaps in the previous social contract (if it can even be considered such) and the various challenges facing the country in this transitional phase, there is a need to build national capacities to conduct credible, free and fair elections that produce a legitimate authority and thus provide a basis for the Constituent Assembly to operate effectively. All support initiatives would need to adopt a holistic approach that looks at both Nation Building and State Building in order to create an environment conducive to democracy.A.Actions related to electoral support:1.Policy advice and technical support to the NTC, the Libyan government and other relevant parties, especially the electoral management bodies on electoral law and the conduct of elections;2.Support for the establishment of an independent electoral management body;3.Capacity building and training of electoral officials, both at the central/national and the local levels;4.Support and training to domestic election observers.B.Actions related to women's empowerment:1.Support to emerging initiatives for the establishment of a Women's National Council intended to implement a mandate to enhance the conditions and foster a conducive environment for women's engagement in the transitional process;2.Tailored and contextualized programmes to support women candidates to increase their chances and to enhance the levels of awareness about the need to include women among the elective options. This may be followed by support to winning women representatives;3.Provision of support/training to political parties (or movements), as needed, on internal party laws and regulations to include women in the âparty systemâ."

Because the parliamentary election law, heavily criticized by the Venice Commission for failing to create a level playing field for participating candidates and parties, failed to address adequately concerns about the transparency and administrative control of the national registry of voters, the Civil Initiative Support Center of Ukraine (CISC - www.cisc.org.ua) undertook a project in late 2011 to train Ukrainians to exercise their legal rights to obtain and confirm the accuracy of their personal information on the list. This project identified several areas of concern which, if unaddressed, will preclude a free and fair parliamentary election. With funding from the National Endowment for Democracy, and through technical support from the International Republican Institute (IRI), CISC initiated this voter registry project which targeted 174 of the 756 representative offices of the State Registry of Voters administrative bodies operating in Ukraine. This project resulted in 522 Ukrainian citizens sending official inquiries about their local voter lists to Regional Departments of the State Register of Voters and approximately 200 inquiries to the Central Electoral Committee. PURPOSE:Given the problems related to voter registry that were identified in its initial project, CISC proposes a second stage of the program to conduct activities seeking to increase the transparent and efficient work of administrative bodies of the State Registry while working to prevent the disenfranchisement of Ukrainian voters on election day. IRI will provide project management oversight and be DFAIT's direct project partner for this initiative, while also continuing to provide technical assistance to CISC.ACTIVITIES:- Dissemination of 175,000 informational brochures on âPublic access to the State Registry of Votersâ - One national-level general training for all program participants including CISC coalition members. - Twenty-seven regional roundtables for information dissemination (one in each oblast and the capital).- Three thousand seven hundred and eighty inquiries to all 756 administrative bodies of the state register. - Questionnaires for the public on the efficiency and transparency of the work of the administrative bodies of the State Registry. - Official inquiries from Ukrainian voters to 378 administrative bodies of the state register of voters to gauge responsiveness prior to the election (about 50% of state registry departments). - The State Registry will be informed about the necessity of following Ukrainian legislation to respond to citizen's issues and concerns. - Continuous monitoring of the voter register and the eventual voter list. - Development of nationwide social network leveraging CISC's 3,000+ current activists and supporters and utilizing crowdsourcing technologies to map out an"

ELOG has organized itself as a comprehensive election monitoring and observation programme. Its aim is to promote trasparency and accountability in the lectoral processes in Kenya and the Africa Region. Taking elections as a process and not an event ELOG has identified seven key thematic issues under which thematic monitoring and observation shall be anchored namely: voter registration monitoring and implenetation of political parties Act and political financing advocacy on electoral law reform and constituency delimitation campaign monitoring promotion and participation of marginalized groups voter education and media monitoring. This is anticipated to set a comprehensive background and environment for actual election-day monittoring and observation which will utize the traditional observation and parallel vote tabulation methodologies for purposes of deterring electoral malpractices and the swift verification of the official results and the credibility of the election-day processesObjectives; to enhance stakeholder awareness on the electoral process undertake comprehensive thematic monitoring and observation of electora process leading to and after the 2012 elections to faciliate the stablishment and build capacity for a peace panel to undertake election day observation through fielding general observers and parallel vote tabulation observers

Because the parliamentary election law, heavily criticized by the Venice Commission for failing to create a level playing field for participating candidates and parties, failed to address adequately concerns about the transparency and administrative control of the national registry of voters, the Civil Initiative Support Center of Ukraine (CISC - www.cisc.org.ua) undertook a project in late 2011 to train Ukrainians to exercise their legal rights to obtain and confirm the accuracy of their personal information on the list. This project identified several areas of concern which, if unaddressed, will preclude a free and fair parliamentary election. With funding from the National Endowment for Democracy, and through technical support from the International Republican Institute (IRI), CISC initiated this voter registry project which targeted 174 of the 756 representative offices of the State Registry of Voters administrative bodies operating in Ukraine. This project resulted in 522 Ukrainian citizens sending official inquiries about their local voter lists to Regional Departments of the State Register of Voters and approximately 200 inquiries to the Central Electoral Committee. PURPOSE:Given the problems related to voter registry that were identified in its initial project, CISC proposes a second stage of the program to conduct activities seeking to increase the transparent and efficient work of administrative bodies of the State Registry while working to prevent the disenfranchisement of Ukrainian voters on election day. IRI will provide project management oversight and be DFAIT's direct project partner for this initiative, while also continuing to provide technical assistance to CISC.ACTIVITIES:- Dissemination of 175,000 informational brochures on 'Public access to the State Registry of Voters' - One national-level general training for all program participants including CISC coalition members. - Twenty-seven regional roundtables for information dissemination (one in each oblast and the capital).- Three thousand seven hundred and eighty inquiries to all 756 administrative bodies of the state register. - Questionnaires for the public on the efficiency and transparency of the work of the administrative bodies of the State Registry. - Official inquiries from Ukrainian voters to 378 administrative bodies of the state register of voters to gauge responsiveness prior to the election (about 50% of state registry departments). - The State Registry will be informed about the necessity of following Ukrainian legislation to respond to citizen's issues and concerns. - Continuous monitoring of the voter register and the eventual voter list. - Development of nationwide social network leveraging CISC's 3,000+ current activists and supporters and utilizing crowdsourcing technologies to map out and pu"

According to the last published OSCE results, in the OSCE region the portion of women representatives in the lower chambers is 24,4%. However, more and more countries introduce legal means to increase legal participation in politics like for example quotas or similar rules. The first step for the development in this field is identifying discriminatory laws, policies and practices, and the 23rd Annual Conference of ACEEEO will give an opportunity for that as well as getting familiar with best practices.Right to vote of women should also be ensured without discrimination and electoral management bodies play a crucial rule also in this field when preparing an electoral process, informing voters, organising trainings for the lower-level electoral management bodies and poll workers. Finally, it is also inevitable to have women in the electoral bodies and in other election-related organisations.The above mentioned development can be conducted only with a strong cooperation among the law-making bodies, electoral management bodies, women rights non-governmental organisations, political parties and other electoral stakeholders.II. 'PLANNING OF A GENERAL ELECTION'General elections are certainly the most complex project that a state organ should implement in a country. In a relatively short period the electoral management bodies have to plan, operate and monitor plenty of different activities from the boundary delimitation, voter registration, establishing the polling committees, election training, voter education, registration of candidates, setting up the polling stations, ensuring the condition for a legal, safe casting of votes till the vote counting, results transmission and handling legal remedies.During the whole process, legal, administrative, logistical, IT, financial and communicational tasks are conducted simultaneously.

The project focuses on three actors, namely the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP), the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission's (IEBC) and the com-peting political parties. The intended support will focus primarily on three essential thematic areas: the electoral legal framework, particularly provisions for sound political finance, both democratic standards and gender equality in candidate nomination; and the overall electoral risk-management framework. The thematic areas identified for support under this proposal are consistent with the Electoral and Political Processes priorities outlined in the Kenya Vision 2030's political pillar. The 2030 Vision aims at enacting and operationalizing the necessary policy, legal and institutional framework to support the development of issue-based political processes through, inter alia:  the introduction of new laws and regulations covering politi-cal parties; the enhancement of the legal and regulatory framework covering the electoral process; and the strengthening of laws to promote the inclusion of women and other marginalized groups in the electoral process . The modalities of support proposed in the project's outputs and activities consist of providing comparative knowledge, creation of dialogue opportunities, strengthening organisational structures, operational capacities, modes of inter-institutional cooperation, and the legislative framework under which the ORPP, the IEBC and competing political parties operate."
