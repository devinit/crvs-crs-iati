In implementing this project, UNDP will work closely with the Ministries of Interior (MOI), Women's Affairs (MOWA), and UNAMA. The project will mainly involve the deployment of international advisors to each IEC Secretariat department. The advisors will mentor each Department Head on day-to-day operations and build capacity through on-the-job coaching.   The joint civil and voter registry will reviewed, and lessons learned from its development will be col-lated and fed into the design and planning of a nationwide joint voter/civil registry exercise which will issue a national identification document (ID) for all citizens above fifteen years of age. The national ID will link the voters to individual polling stations preventing the risk of issuing multiple voter registration cards to a single voter. It will also be used to establish polling stations in locations that will improve the accessibility of the voters.   The Voter and Civil Registration pilot project will strive to link up with other government projects im-plemented by the Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Interior, which are also based on extending and systematizing the government's administrative control at the sub-national level through the use of com-mon processes and documents.   To implement this project, UNDP will coordinate closely with other similar projects by Asia (TAF) Foundation and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), both funded by USAID in order to maximize impact and avoid duplication.

In 2007 the IPU will organize a three-day regional seminar for parliaments from post-conflict English-speaking African countries with the aim of strengthening the participating parliaments' capacity to promote reconciliation.  The seminar will target the parliaments of Ghana, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Uganda.   In 2008, two-day national seminars will follow the regional, introductory ones, in countries where the needs and commitment of the parliament to strengthen its involvement in the reconciliation process and to establish a national plan of action have been reconfirmed during the regional seminar.   During the second and third year of the project, follow-up and evaluation visits will be carried out to each of the parliaments that has hosted a national seminar, in order to take stock of progress, identify problems that may have arisen, verify the viability of the action plan elaborated during the national seminar and revise it accordingly with the help of the focus group. In 2009, an updated version of the Handbook entitled Making reconciliation work: The role of parliaments, originally published by the IPU and International IDEA in 2005, will be issued so as to reflected experiences and developments that have since taken place in the region and globally.Expected Impact: To help create the conditions for sustainable development in conflict-affected countries.Expected Outcomes: At the request of its governing bodies, the IPU organized a regional seminar on reconciliation for African parliaments in Bujumbura, Burundi, in November 2005.  Participants at the seminar expressed the need for further tailored IPU action to assist their countries and parliaments in their national reconciliation processes.   The project responds to this wish and aims to strengthen the ability of post-conflict parliaments to establish, monitor, assess, and provide follow-up on the work of transitional justice mechanisms, such as truth and reconciliation commissions, trials, reparation programmes for victims and judicial reforms, and to strengthen inclusive political processes as an essential element of reconciliation.   As a result, parliamentarians should have an increased awareness of what the field of transitional justice has to offer and knowledge of the possible pitfalls that they may encounter on the road to reconciliation.  They should also become more involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of transitional justice mechanisms and be in a better position to reflect the needs and aspirations of all segments of society, which should, in the final analysis, raise the credibility and viability of the reconciliation process as a whole. Indicators of success include increased parliamentary debate and legislative action to set up truth and reconciliation commissions, and/or to implement recommendations of such commissions, particularly in the areas of institutional reform and reparation for victims. Expected Outputs: The project's expected results include: 1. Increased ability of post-conflict parliaments to establish, monitor, assess and provide follow-up on the work of transitional justice mechanisms. 2. Heightened awareness and knowledge of parliaments of what the field of transitional justice has to offer. 3. Greater involvement of parliamentarians in the design, implementation and evaluation of transitional justice mechanisms. 4.

The lack of a civil identity in Haiti leaves millions of people unable to access basic services, apply for credit, obtain title to property, or vote. In broader terms, they are unable to participate fully in the economic, political, and democratic life of their country. The goal of this project is to make civil registration more accessible to all Haitians.   The main project activities include the digitization of 14 million historic records from the National Archives and their conversion to a secure electronic database; training and coaching for ONI supervisors and employees on the use of the new automated system; and the implementation of nation-wide campaigns to promote the registration of children. By the end of the project, the registration rate for children is expected to rise from 30% to 95%, and the overall registration rate to near 100%. The project also aims to provide adults with access to national identity cards.   Results as of November 2010 include: 8.6 million historic records have been digitized, to keep the information secure and accessible and to provide statistics for social planning. 4.7 million Haitians over 18 (94% of the population) are now registered. Hundreds of government employees have received training on the use of the new technologies.   Since the January 12, 2010 earthquake, 18,500 children have been registered through mobile units set up in displaced persons camps. This helps to protect children, particularly unaccompanied minors. Mobile units were also deployed to register voters for the elections of November 2010, to record changes of address, and to issue over 300,000 new or replacement national identity cards.   All these activities are helping to provide Haitians with greater access to government services. / L'objectif du projet est de renforcer l'Office National d'Identification (ONI) pour qu'il soit en mesure de consolider et de moderniser sa capacité à maintenir un système d'identification et d'enregistrement national unifié qui soit pérenne, universellement accessible, sécuritaire et non discriminatoire.   Faute d'identité officielle, des millions d'Haïtiens n'ont toujours pas accès aux services de base, ne peuvent obtenir du crédit ou des titres de propriété et ne peuvent voter. De façon plus générale, les citoyens sans identité officielle ne peuvent participer pleinement à la vie économique, politique et démocratique de leur pays. Le but de ce projet est de rendre l'enregistrement plus accessible à tous les Haïtiens.   Parmi les activités principales du projet, mentionnons la conversion de 14 millions de documents historiques des archives nationales en banque de données électroniques sécurisée, la formation et l'accompagnement des superviseurs et des employés de l'ONI dans l'emploi du nouveau système automatisé et l'organisation de campagnes nationales afin de promouvoir l'enregistrement des enfants. À la fin du projet, le taux d'enregistrement des enfants au registre civil haïtien sera passé de 30% à 95%, et le taux d'enregistrement général frôlera 100%. Le projet vise aussi à permettre aux adultes d'obtenir une carte d'identité nationale.   Parmi les résultats obtenus jusqu'en novembre 2010 : 8,6 millions de documents historiques ont été numérisés afin de protéger l'information et le rendre accessible, en plus de fournir des statistiques pour la planification sociale. 4,7 millions d'Haïtiens qui plus de 18 ans (94 % de la population) sont maintenant enregistrés.

MANAGEMENT,"This project's objective is to enable Haiti's National Identification Office (Office national d'identification (ONI)) to consolidate and modernize its capacity to maintain a unified national civil registration and identification system that is permanent, universally accessible, secure, and non-discriminatory.   The lack of a civil identity in Haiti leaves millions of people unable to access basic services, apply for credit, obtain title to property, or vote. In broader terms, they are unable to participate fully in the economic, political, and democratic life of their country. The goal of this project is to make civil registration more accessible to all Haitians.   The main project activities include the digitization of 14 million historic records from the National Archives and their conversion to a secure electronic database; training and coaching for ONI supervisors and employees on the use of the new automated system; and the implementation of nation-wide campaigns to promote the registration of children. By the end of the project, the registration rate for children is expected to rise from 30% to 95%, and the overall registration rate to near 100%. The project also aims to provide adults with access to national identity cards.   Results as of November 2010 include: 8.6 million historic records have been digitized, to keep the information secure and accessible and to provide statistics for social planning. 4.7 million Haitians over 18 (94% of the population) are now registered. Hundreds of government employees have received training on the use of the new technologies.   Since the January 12, 2010 earthquake, 18,500 children have been registered through mobile units set up in displaced persons camps. This helps to protect children, particularly unaccompanied minors. Mobile units were also deployed to register voters for the elections of November 2010, to record changes of address, and to issue over 300,000 new or replacement national identity cards.

The Tunisian authorities have committed to hold elections, possibly for a Constituent Assembly, by mid-July.  Yet for the election to be considered credible, the quality of the Tunisian voter register will need to be assured.  The current voter register is considered to be out of date and inaccurate, and will allow for the participation of only a proportion of eligible citizens.  Alternative methods for improving the voter register  including through creating a new register to be extracted form the National ID card database  may be effective but are untested. The body responsible for determining whether or not to adopt a new voter register during their preparations of a new Electoral Code  the Technical Commission for Political Reform and Democratic Transition (TCPR)  has limited technical knowledge and experience in core electoral issues generally, and on approaches for voter registration reform in particular.  In order to successfully address the issues related to voter registration, the TCPR needs immediate support to build its capacity through technical advice and assistance.  IFES proposes to provide rapid response to the TCPR's needs via the provision of immediate expert consultations and assistance, including for the possibility of feasibility studies and reviews of proposed options."

The lack of a civil identity in Haiti leaves millions of people unable to access basic services, apply for credit, obtain title to property, or vote. In broader terms, they are unable to participate fully in the economic, political, and democratic life of their country. The goal of this project is to make civil registration more accessible to all Haitians.   The main project activities include: the digitization of 14 million historic records from the National Archives and their conversion to a secure electronic database; training and coaching for ONI supervisors and employees on the use of the new automated system; and the implementation of nation-wide campaigns to promote the registration of children. By the end of the project, it is expected to have close to universal registration rates for children and adults. The project also aims to provide adults with access to national identity cards. / L'objectif du projet est de renforcer l'Office National d'Identification (ONI) pour qu'il soit en mesure de développer et maintenir un système d'identification et d'enregistrement national qui soit universellement accessible, sécuritaire et non discriminatoire.   Faute d'identité officielle, des millions d'Haïtiens n'ont toujours pas accès aux services de base, ne peuvent obtenir du crédit ou des titres de propriété et ne peuvent voter. De façon plus générale, les citoyens sans identité officielle ne peuvent participer pleinement à la vie économique, politique et démocratique de leur pays. Le but de ce projet est de rendre l'enregistrement plus accessible à tous les Haïtiens.   Parmi les activités principales du projet, mentionnons : la conversion de 14 millions de documents historiques des Archives nationales en banque de données électroniques sécurisée; la formation et l'accompagnement des superviseurs et des employés de l'ONI dans l'emploi du nouveau système automatisé; l'organisation de campagnes nationales afin de promouvoir l'enregistrement des enfants. À la fin du projet, il est attendu que le taux d'enregistrement des enfants et des adultes sera presque universel. Le projet vise aussi à permettre aux adultes d'obtenir une carte d'identité nationale."

A reconstitution process going on of Mapuche land since 1994. To date, a mere 1% of the total reclaimed land is returned. The returned lands are often damaged in terms of soil, ecosystems at large and also extensive cultural modifications have as such taken place.  The Project as such wants to establish native forest nurseries using traditional organic cultivating practices, which would be retaining groundwater. The project will be constructing a demonstrative wind and solar energy installation to draw water, which would be serving domestic purposes as well. In this way the needs of families would be met, traditional cultivating practices would be restored, whilst at the same time a non industrial ecological alternative energy source would be put in place, the experience of which is hoped to be replicated later on elsewhere. FUDEAR is a small organisation established in 2006, which unites 5 part time salaried personel, and works furthermore with a small body of volunteers. Turnover in 2010 was 120.000 euro. Its small scale activities are aiming to improve the socio-economic conditions of vulnerable groups, small entreprises and entrepreneurs as well as Mapuche communities. FUDEAR works together with State institutions and various representative entities of the mentioned groups.

The project reinforces national registrars so they can register 95% of newborns each year and improve service delivery to vulnerable unregistered children in target countries. A birth certificate allows children to access health services and education, giving them the opportunity to achieve their full potential as active and productive citizens. Children are the primary beneficiaries of the project, but some activities are also aimed at vulnerable unregistered adults.   Project activities include the following: (1) improving governments' capacity to design and apply policies to facilitate inclusive civil registration, by developing national work plans, training registrars and providing technical assistance to the selected national governments; (2) improving registrars' capacity to register unregistered children in a timely and secure manner and to educate unregistered persons about their civil registration rights and responsibilities, by implementing tools to measure the level of service delivery to children, training officials in delivering services to everyone, and modernizing technological equipment to better protect personal information; (3) building governments' capacity to use international standards in managing civil registries and to recognize identity documents from other countries, by sharing best practices, training employees and translating key documents for dissemination.   The project is in keeping with Canada's priorities for strengthening child protection and supporting maternal, newborn and child health. / Ce projet vise à améliorer la protection des enfants et d'autres personnes vulnérables en Amérique latine et dans les Caraibes par un appui à l'enregistrement des naissances de deux millions d'enfants de moins de cinq ans, facilitant l'accès des personnes à une identité juridique.

Phase III? which ended on December 31 2016 in the amount of ?10912.33 Euro. The proposed conference ?Palestinian Naksa of 1967 and Its Implications? is the 15th in this series and it deals with an extremely critical theme and issue to the Palestinian population first and foremost but also to the regional and international stakeholders which is the 1967 War. the proposed conference has four key themes : First Palestinian secular nationalism and the resurgence of Islamist ideology and its sociological manifestations; Second the role of Christian Zionism and its political/biblical narrative; Third the displacement of Palestinians and the construction of settler communities as well as the spread of settlement outposts; Fourth collective memory of the conflict and its role in shaping national identity across Palestinian communities. the conference?s outputs are to enhance the rights and status of women and gender equality since the conference deals with a historical event that has transformed the social religious and political landscape of Palestine in profound and dramatic ways which led to the demise of secular Arab nationalism and the rise of Islamism and its sociological manifestations in the Palestinian society including impacting negatively the rights and status of women. besides the resulting Israeli military occupation of Palestinian land and its people and the settlements and the separation wall have worked further to strengthen the traditional reactionary and negative societal attitudes perceptions and ultimately practices against Palestinian women. As such a deep study of that momentous event and its effects can greatly help in finding realistic informed solutions recommendations and scenarios to help improve the lives rights and role of Palestinian women and other marginalized groups who were gravely and negatively impacted by the 1967 Naksa and lead the way forward to a better future. Finally the expected outcome of this conference aside from the papers submitted is a short film of 30 minutes with the conference contributions to share its results reflections and recommendations with broader groups including academicians and experts institutions libraries and other stakeholders in the rest of the world.

De plus, le pays est particulièrement vulnérable aux catastrophes naturelles. Depuis 2009, le pays a connu de très nombreux déplacements internes de ses citoyens, en raison des opérations de sécurité menées par l'armée dans les zones tribales sous administration fédérale (ZTAF). Selon les estimations, 3,4 millions de personnes auront besoin d'aide humanitaire en 2017.Avec l'appui d'Affaires mondiales Canada (AMC), CARE Canada fournit au Waziristan du Nord des ZTAF un soutien aux moyens de subsistance et un accès accru à l'eau potable pour 26 000 personnes déplacées à l'interne ou touchées par les conflits et les populations rentrées au pays.

It is timely to reflect on the successes, challenges and lessons from efforts to address the underlying issues, including Kenya's ethnically-driven politics. Since 2008, significant steps have been taken to promote national unity and a more cohesive and positive national identity that embraces and protects Kenya's diverse communities. This event is particularly relevant given the recently concluded Kenya elections which took place in August 2017, which demonstrated the positive steps taken to prevent a repeat of the 2017 violence, but also the problematic underlying issues that remain. The Kenyan case provides important lessons for countries undergoing major social and political transitions, and for local and international actors that aim to provide more effective support to those transitions.  This event is targeted to a global audience of policy-makers, international cooperation experts, academics and activists working to improve governance and advance pluralism around the world. IDRC support to this event also underlines recent funding to GCP towards developing an analytical research framework on pluralism, and to explore concrete expressions of strengthening pluralism in public policy."
