Civil society credibly monitors and reports on key emerging issues related to elections; and

▪	Objective 2: Enhanced Advocacy for Reform. Civil society implements evidence-based advocacy campaigns to contribute constructively to policy and practice reforms related to elections. Since 2010, The Carter Center’s Citizen Observation (CO) program in the DRC has been working with the Catholic Church’s Episcopal Commission for Justice and Peace (CENCO/CEJP) to strengthen their capacity to promote democratic elections in the DRC by independently conducting meaningful observation of electoral processes.  With support from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Carter Center staff will continue working with CENCO/CEJP to strengthen their ability to identify and respond quickly and effectively to key issues and aspects of the electoral process that are vulnerable to manipulation, to gather data specifically related to those areas, and to develop strong and targeted recommendations to stakeholders to address those issues and minimize impact on the electoral process. Small sub-grants will be provided to gather targeted data and then use it to facilitate timely outreach, advocacy and follow-up activities. This will also help increase partner CSOs’ financial and grants management capacity. ",Congo (The Democratic Republic Of The),"",2017,475000.00,Incoming Funds

The main focus of this project is to improve transparency credibility and inclusiveness in Mozambique's local and general elections in 2018 and 2019. The project offers training support and new tools for the election officials district judges and the civil
 society. Mozambique has faced challenges with credibility and transparency in the election process during previous elections. Turnout has been low the declaration of the final results has been delayed and the complaint-procedures have been difficult and u
nclear. In the general elections of 2019 the provincial governors will be elected by voters for the first time. This supports the decentralization of political power in Mozambique and therefore it is crucial that the elections are conducted as transparentl
y credibly and inclusively as possible. The electoral support to Mozambique will increase transparency and inclusion in the electoral process develop training and new tools for election officials and other stakeholders increase the participation of women a
nd young voters in the electoral process as well as improve the mechanisms for electoral disputes.The project aims to increase equality the fulfillment of rights of women and girls the political parties' ability to use electoral complaint-procedures and to
 increase turnout. The project is administered by the UNDP and has been planned in close cooperation with the Technical Secretariat for the Administration of Election and National Elections Committee which are the key Election Management Bodies in Mozambiq

The main focus of this project is to improve transparency credibility and inclusiveness in Mozambique's local and general elections in 2018 and 2019. The project offers training support and new tools for the election officials district judges and the civil
 society. Mozambique has faced challenges with credibility and transparency in the election process during previous elections. Turnout has been low the declaration of the final results has been delayed and the complaint-procedures have been difficult and u
nclear. In the general elections of 2019 the provincial governors will be elected by voters for the first time. This supports the decentralization of political power in Mozambique and therefore it is crucial that the elections are conducted as transparentl
y credibly and inclusively as possible. The electoral support to Mozambique will increase transparency and inclusion in the electoral process develop training and new tools for election officials and other stakeholders increase the participation of women a
nd young voters in the electoral process as well as improve the mechanisms for electoral disputes.The project aims to increase equality the fulfillment of rights of women and girls the political parties' ability to use electoral complaint-procedures and to
 increase turnout. The project is administered by the UNDP and has been planned in close cooperation with the Technical Secretariat for the Administration of Election and National Elections Committee which are the key Election Management Bodies in Mozambiq
